# Mantra Bash Scripts
1). Write a small script that will take 3 parameters in any order. -A 100 -B 110 -C 120. It can also come as -C 120 -A 100 -C 110. You should check for all parameters and print error if missing. Setup github gist or repo. *

Check one.sh file

2). Write a script which will take the location of the file (eg: nginx https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elastic/examples/master/Common%20Data%20Formats/nginx_logs/nginx_logs) and status code. Return the count of how many times the status has come. Eg: 301, 404, 200 etc. *

check second.sh file

3). Write a small script that will take 3 bash variables - 2 input video files and output video file location. Validate input. Your script should combine the two input files and output to the location. You can use any utility or program to actually do the mixing. *
